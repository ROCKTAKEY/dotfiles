** Getting started
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  git clone https://github.com/ROCKTAKEY/dotfiles ~/
  cd ~/dotfiles
  stow [directory-name]...
#+END_SRC

*** Example on GNU Guix System
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  stow cookiecutter emacs git guix guix-system oj rhq
#+END_SRC

If you want to reconfigure GNU Guix System, you can run:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  sudo guix archive --authorize < ~/dotfiles/guix-config/signing-keys/signing-key.pub
  sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm --substitute-urls='https://ci.guix.gnu.org https://bordeaux.guix.gnu.org https://substitutes.nonguix.org'
#+END_SRC

With GNU Guix, all almost dependencies can be installed.
Note that some packages are defined on [[https://github.com/ROCKTAKEY/roquix][roquix]], which is my channel for guix, or some other public channels.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  guix pull
  guix install python-cookiecutter emacs cmigemo migemo-dict the-silver-searcher git online-judge-tools online-judge-template-generator rust-rhq
#+END_SRC

*** Example on wslg
#+BEGIN_SRC shell -n
  stow cookiecutter emacs git oj rhq wslg guix
#+END_SRC

** Git signing
1. Make your own gpg key by `gpg --full-gen-key`
2. Show your own key name by `gpg --list-keys`
3. Add to =~/.config/git/config.local=:
   #+begin_src conf-toml :tangle yes
     [user]
         signingKey = <keyname>!
   #+end_src
   Note that exclamation mark should be needed.

** GitHub account switching
=ghs= is from [[https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/326#issuecomment-1039901475]].

1. =stow git=
2. Login to one account
3. Rename ~./config/gh/hosts.yml~ to ID
4. Login to another account
5. Rename ~./config/gh/hosts.yml~ to ID
6. Now you can switch to =<ID>= account by =ghs <ID>=
